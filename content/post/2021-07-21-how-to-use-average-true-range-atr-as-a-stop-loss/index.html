<div id="what-is-atr" class="section level2">
<h2>What is ATR?</h2>
<p>ATR essentially measures how much a given security moves during your employed time period. If you’re on the 1 minute time frame and ATR is 0.08, then the price of that security is moving about 8 cents per minute. If you’re still curious, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atr.asp">Investopedia</a> has a more in depth explanation.</p>

<div id="how-to-use-atr" class="section level2">
<h2>How to use ATR</h2>
<p>Stop-loss = Price - (ATR * Risk Factor)</p>
<p><strong>Take the current value of ATR and multiply it by 3, then subtract that number from the current price of the security.</strong> That’s your stop loss. I say 3 in this example but the risk factor is up to you. Somewhere between 2.5-3.5 is generally the specified factor of choice, however this can change depending on the volatility of the security. A security with greater volatility may require a larger risk factor since the price has a greater chance to make larger swings. Finally, be careful not to set your stop loss too close to the current price, or you risk activating your stop price prematurely.</p>
<div id="example" class="section level4">
<h4>Example:</h4>
<pre><code>Price: 434.95
ATR: 0.09
Risk factor: 3
Stop-loss: 434.95-(0.09*3) = 434.67</code></pre>
<p><img src="Images/exampleatr.png" width="800" height="350" /></p>
<p>Here the price of SPY is $434.95. Using the current value of ATR at the time, 0.09, we get a stop loss of $434.67.</p>

<div id="why-use-atr" class="section level2">
<h2>Why use ATR?</h2>
<p>ATR allows you to set a more dynamic stop loss by taking a security’s current volatility into consideration. As a result, the indicator will help prevent getting stopped out of a trade prematurely while still inputting a certain level of protection into it.</p>
