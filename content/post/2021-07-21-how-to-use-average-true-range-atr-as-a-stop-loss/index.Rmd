## What is ATR?

ATR is an indicator that essentially measures how much a given security moves during your employed time period. If you're on the 1 minute time frame and ATR is 0.13, then the price of that security is moving about 13 cents per minute. If you're still curious, [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atr.asp) has a more in-depth explanation.

Here's a previous of what the indicator can look like. As you can tell, the value of ATR will change as the volatility of the underlying security changes throughout the day.

## Why use ATR?

ATR allows you to set a more dynamic stop loss by taking a security's volatility into consideration. Using ATR to create your stop loss will help prevent getting stopped out of a trade prematurely by random noise, while still giving you the added security that a traditional stop-loss offers. 

## How to use ATR

> **Stop-loss = Price - (ATR * Risk Factor)**

Take the value of ATR and multiply it by 3, then subtract that number from the current price of the security. That's your stop loss. 

I say 3 in this example but the risk factor is up to you. Somewhere between 1-3.5 is generally the specified factor of choice and is largely dependent on the volatility of the security, your employed time frame, and your own risk tolerance.

However, be careful not to set your stop loss too close to the current price, or you risk activating your stop price prematurely. 

#### Example:

```
Price: 434.95
ATR: 0.09
Risk factor: 3
Stop-loss: 434.95-(0.09*3) = 434.67
```

Here the price of SPY is $434.95. Using the current value of ATR at the time, 0.09, we get a stop loss of $434.67. 

## Considerations

The point in time at which you take your ATR value is important and I recommend experimenting to see what works for you. Some people prefer taking the ATR value at the previous candle's closing price, but this may differ from trader to trader. Just be sure to collect the ATR value in the same time frame you plan to trade on.
