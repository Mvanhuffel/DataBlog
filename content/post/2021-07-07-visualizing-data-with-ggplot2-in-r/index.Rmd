## Summary

This post will quickly walk you through the basics on how to visualize your data using ggplot2. The gg stands for the grammar of graphics, and each plot is composed of three fundamental parts: 

**Data**: Your data frame.

**Aesthetics**: The x and y variables, as well as any other aesthetic configurations (color, size, shape, etc.).

**Geometry**: The type of graph you wish to visualize your data as (line, box plot, histogram, etc.).

------------------------

## The dataset

First we need to load the tidyverse package in order to gain access to ggplot2 and other functions. 


```
library(tidyverse)
-- Attaching packages ----------------------- tidyverse 1.3.1 --
v ggplot2 3.3.5     v purrr   0.3.4
v tibble  3.1.2     v dplyr   1.0.7
v tidyr   1.1.3     v stringr 1.4.0
v readr   1.4.0     v forcats 0.5.1
-- Conflicts -------------------------- tidyverse_conflicts() --
x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
x dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()
```
Next load your data. For this example, we'll load some data on gold prices taken from [datahub.io](https://datahub.io/).
```
gold <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\Mtvan\\Desktop\\GoldPrices.csv", fileEncoding = "UTF-8-BOM")
```
A brief look at what the data looks like. 
```
head(gold)

year	price
2014	1200.440
2015	1068.317
2016	1152.165
2017	1265.674
2018	1249.887
2019	1480.025
```
## Creating a ggplot

To start a plot, we write ```ggplot()```, after which we supply a dataset and aesthetic mapping using ```aes()```. To finish we input our preferred geometry, like ```geom_point()```, which adds a layer of points to the graph and creates a scatter plot.

To plot our gold data, we run the following code with year on the x-axis, and price on the y-axis. 


```
ggplot(gold, aes(x=year, y=price)) +
    geom_point()
```

## Aesthetic Mapping

Other variables from your data frame can be added to the two dimensional scatterplot by mapping it to the aesthetic. Aesthetics can range anywhere from size, shape, or even color of the points.

To do this, we associate the name of the aesthetic to the name of the variable inside the ```aes()``` function. ggplot2 will automatically assign a unique color of the aesthetic to each unique value (called scaling), while also creating a legend to explain which colors correspond to which values.

```
ggplot(data = gold) +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = year, y = price, color = sentiment))
```



![](images/GoldSentiment.png#center)
```
show.legend = FALSE
```

We can also manually set the aesthetic properties of the geom like so.  

```
ggplot(data = gold) +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = year, y= price, color = "red")
```

Another possible aesthetic is size. We get a warning here since we mapped an unordered variable to an ordered aesthetic, which isn't usually recommended. 

```
ggplot(data= gold) +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = year, y = price, size = sentiment))
Warning message:
Using size for a discrete variable is not advised. 
```

***Alpha*** aesthetic:
```
ggplot(data = gold) +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = year, y = price, alpha = sentiment))
```

## Facets

We can also split our plot into facets, which will create subplots and divide our data into individual subsets. 
```
ggplot(data = gold) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = year, y = price)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ sentiment, nrow = 2)
```

## Geometric Objects

The geoms are what determine how ggplot will visually represent our data. There are dozens of geoms available in ggplot2, and even more if you download additional extensions. [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) also offers some cheatsheets for quick references. 

```
ggplot(data = gold) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = year, y = price))
```



![](images/GoldSmooth.png#center)

To display multiple geoms in one plot, we can add multiple geom functions. 

```
ggplot(data = gold) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = year, y = price)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = year, y = price))
```

## Additional Tips

- If one of your variables contains a space in the name, surround it with ` `` ` (e.g. `` `new data` ``) to avoid errors. 

- You can add a title to your plot with
```
ggtitle("title")
```

- You can remove a legend from a plot with

```
theme(legend.position = "none")
```

- You can save a plot to disk with
```
ggsave()
```
